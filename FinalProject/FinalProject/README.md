## **West Nile Virus Mosquito Spraying**

The city of Boulder is conducting an analysis
on the neighborhoods close to bodies of water,
that might harbor mosquitoes carrying the
West Nile Virus. This analysis to help in the prevention
and spread of West Nile Virus in the Community. 


The following app is tasked with finding
addresses within the mosquito spraying
layer (a 1500-foot buffer from all bodies of water).
These are addresses are to be contacted 
to bring awareness of spraying times. It takes into consideration
open bodies of water(Lake and Reservoirs), parks, open space and mountain parks,
mosquito larval sites, wetlands and Boulder addresses. 


For those who have health risks and
wish to not be in the spraying zone.A Google form can be filled out 
for those who have allergies/asthma or health concerns- this will
ensure a 1500-foot buffer of no spraying from the address. This will
be the avoid point layer which will be erased from the mosquito spraying 
layer. After this the program will display the addresses of those
to be contacted for mosquito spraying.
